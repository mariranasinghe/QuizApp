## 📖 How It Works

The application is a full suite of tools, not just a single quiz app.

1. **Quiz Game (Default View)**: The app initiates by loading the main Quiz Game interface. From here, users can immediately start playing by:
    - Choosing a quiz category (like Geography, Science, or History).
    - Selecting a game mode (e.g., Normal Mode or Timed Mode).
    - Tracking their progress, high scores, and overall accuracy.

2. **Study Apps Dashboard**: By clicking the "Apps" button (the grid icon in the top-right corner) <img width="30" height="55" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d8648c9-6eff-4274-89bc-70d63e8807c2" />
, users are taken to the central "Study Apps" dashboard. 
From this hub, they can navigate to any of the other helpful utilities.

## ✨ Features
